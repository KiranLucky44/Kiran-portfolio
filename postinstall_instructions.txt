Post-install instructions:

1) Run `npm install` to install new dependencies added for Tailwind and Framer Motion.
2) Start the dev server with `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173
3) If Tailwind classes don't appear, ensure `postcss` is running (Vite handles this automatically after install).
